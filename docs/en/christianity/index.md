# Why Christianity Is Trash?

This page explains the problematic aspects of Christianity as a religion and ideology.

## Introduction

Christianity, despite its claims of love and compassion, contains numerous contradictions, harmful teachings, and outdated dogmas that are incompatible with modern values of human rights, scientific thinking, and social justice.

## Key Issues

### 1. Treatment of Women

- Biblical texts requiring women to submit to men (Ephesians 5:22-24)
- Prohibition of women teaching or having authority over men (1 Timothy 2:11-12)
- Historical discrimination against women in church hierarchy

### 2. LGBTQ+ Rights

- Condemnation of homosexuality as an "abomination" (Leviticus 18:22)
- Refusal of many churches to bless same-sex marriages
- Practice of "conversion therapy" to "cure" homosexuality

### 3. Scientific Ignorance

- Denial of evolution in favor of creationism
- Historical persecution of scientists (Galileo, Giordano Bruno)
- Resistance to medical advances and contraception

### 4. Moral Hypocrisy

- Concept of "forgiveness" allows avoidance of responsibility for crimes
- Indulgences and "buying" salvation in church history
- Protection of pedophiles among clergy

### 5. Violence and Wars

- Crusades and religious wars
- Inquisition and burning of "witches"
- Justification of slavery using biblical texts

### 6. Psychological Manipulation

- Concept of "original sin" creates guilt from childhood
- Fear of hell as a means of control
- Promises of afterlife rewards in exchange for earthly suffering

### 7. Economic Exploitation

- Requirement of tithing (10% of income) from believers
- Wealth of churches while parishioners remain poor
- Sale of "holy" relics and indulgences

## Biblical Contradictions

- Two different creation stories in Genesis
- Different genealogies of Jesus in the Gospels
- Contradictory moral commandments (love vs. revenge)

## Conclusion

While many Christians are good and moral people, Christian teaching itself contains numerous toxic elements that contribute to discrimination, suppression of critical thinking, and social injustice. Modern society needs humanistic ethics based on reason and compassion, not ancient dogmas and superstitions.

It's important to distinguish between criticism of religious ideology and attacks on believing people. This criticism is directed at problematic aspects of Christian teaching, not at individual Christians.
