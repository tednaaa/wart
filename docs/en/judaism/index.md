# Why Judaism Is Trash?

This page explains the problematic aspects of Judaism as a religion and ideology.

## Introduction

Judaism, being one of the oldest monotheistic religions, contains numerous archaic laws, discriminatory practices, and dogmatic beliefs that are incompatible with modern values of equality, human rights, and rational thinking.

## Key Issues

### 1. Racism and Ethnic Chauvinism

- Concept of "chosen people" creating a sense of superiority
- Prohibitions on intermarriage with non-Jews
- Different laws for Jews and non-Jews in halakha

### 2. Treatment of Women

- Women cannot be witnesses in religious courts
- Orthodox prohibitions on female clergy
- Ritual "impurity" of women during menstruation (niddah)
- Women are not counted in minyan (quorum for prayer)

### 3. Religious Practices

- Circumcision of infants without their consent
- Cruel methods of kosher animal slaughter
- Sabbath restrictions that interfere with normal life

### 4. Resistance to Science

- Denial of evolution in orthodox circles
- Prohibition on autopsy hindering medical research
- Preference for religious education over secular

### 5. Social Isolation

- Creation of ghettos and isolated communities
- Refusal to integrate into modern society
- Discrimination against secular Jews by orthodox

### 6. Political Issues

- Using religion to justify territorial claims
- Theocratic tendencies in Israel
- Influence of religious parties on secular legislation

### 7. Economic Privileges

- Exemption of religious students from military service
- State funding of religious institutions
- Rabbinical monopoly on marriage registration

## Talmudic Problems

- Discriminatory laws regarding non-Jews
- Archaic punishments and legal procedures
- Contradictions between different Talmudic schools

## Modern Manifestations

- Ultra-orthodox resistance to modernity
- Enforcement of religious laws through the state
- Discrimination against women and LGBTQ+ in religious communities

## Conclusion

While the Jewish people have made enormous contributions to science, culture, and civilization, Judaism as a religious system contains numerous problematic elements that hinder equality, progress, and human dignity. Modern society needs ethical systems based on universal human values, not ancient tribal laws.

It's important to note that criticism of Judaism as a religious ideology is not anti-Semitism. This criticism is directed at religious concepts and practices, not at the Jewish people as an ethnic group.
