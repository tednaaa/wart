# Why Islam Is Trash?

This page explains the problematic aspects of Islam as a religion and ideology.

## Introduction

Islam, like many organized religions, contains numerous contradictions, harmful practices, and outdated beliefs that are incompatible with modern values of human rights, equality, and rational thinking.

## Key Issues

### 1. Treatment of Women

- Unequal inheritance laws
- Restrictions on women's freedom and autonomy
- Permissive attitudes toward domestic violence in certain interpretations

### 2. LGBTQ+ Rights

- Explicit condemnation and criminalization of homosexuality
- Death penalty for same-sex relationships in some Islamic countries
- No recognition of gender identity or sexual orientation diversity

### 3. Freedom of Religion and Apostasy

- Death penalty for leaving Islam (apostasy) in traditional interpretations
- Forced conversion and religious persecution
- Blasphemy laws that restrict free speech and criticism

### 4. Violence and Extremism

- Verses that can be interpreted to justify violence against non-believers
- Historical and contemporary examples of religious extremism
- Concept of jihad being misused to justify terrorism

### 5. Scientific and Rational Thinking

- Conflicts with evolutionary biology and modern science
- Discouragement of questioning religious doctrines
- Reliance on faith over evidence-based reasoning

## Conclusion

While many Muslims are peaceful and moderate in their beliefs, the fundamental texts and traditional interpretations of Islam contain numerous problematic elements that conflict with modern humanistic values and human rights principles.

It's important to note that criticism of religious ideas and ideologies is different from prejudice against people who follow those religions. This critique is directed at the belief system itself, not at individual Muslims as people.
